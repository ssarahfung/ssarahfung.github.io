          <div class="body-text">As this is my first project on Figma, I played around with different elements while focusing on my main goal: To create a useful tool for students who want to become more financially literate. Outside of the colourful theme, the app encompasses two important aspects: information and education. When using banking apps, I constantly felt like I was behind on "understanding" finance. Which is why I wanted to design something that is visually appealing and also provides everything someone needs to grow in their financial journey. The app provides a simple account summary along with spending reports and budgeting tools to help you keep on track. Finally, the user can also manage their investments while being able to access learning resources about stocks, investing, and all things financial.  </div>
